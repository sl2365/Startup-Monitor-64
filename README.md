# Startup Monitor (AutoIt)

## Overview

This Windows tray application monitors system startup locations, scheduled tasks, and registry entries for changes or new items. It alerts the user to new startup entries, lets the user approve or deny them, and provides options for logging and deletion. All configuration and log files are stored in a dedicated `App` folder within the application's directory.

The app can be used to monitor any custom location added by the user, so this could serve as an app monitor, checking for changes in folders or registry locations.

---

## Features

- **Monitors**:
  - User-specified startup folders (e.g. Startup menus).
  - Scheduled tasks (Windows Task Scheduler).
  - Registry locations (stubbed, expandable).
  - Locations can be enabled/disabled on a per-item basis.
- **Allows/Denies**:
  - New entries alert the user with a review GUI.
  - User can allow (approve) or deny (block/delete) new items.
  - Denied items are deleted after confirmation.
- **Persistence**:
  - Baseline snapshot on first run (never updated except on reset).
  - Tracks Allowed and Denied items separately for user decisions.
- **Logging**:
  - All actions are logged to `Log.ini`.
- **Tray Menu**:
  - Open settings
  - Exit

## Folder and File Structure

All files are created in:  
`[AppFolder]\App`

| File Name           | Purpose                                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowed.ini         | User-allowed startup/scheduled task items                                 |
| Denied.ini          | User-denied startup/scheduled task items                                  |
| Log.ini             | Log of all actions (Last 30 days)                                         |
| Settings.ini        | App settings/configuration                                                |
| BaseStartup.ini     | Baseline snapshot of startup items at first run                           |
| BaseTasks.ini       | Baseline snapshot of scheduled tasks at first run                         |
| Locations.ini       | List of monitored locations (folders and registry keys)                   |

---

## Usage

1. **First Run**  
   - Creates the `App` folder and all required files with default values.
   - Takes baseline snapshots of startup folders and scheduled tasks.

2. **Monitoring**  
   - The app polls monitored locations at the interval set in Settings GUI: MonitorTime, default: 3000ms. The longer the time, the less resources required.
   - Finds new items, compares them to baseline and Allowed/Denied lists, reports to user.

3. **Review GUI**  
   - New or changed items open a review dialog with checkboxes:
     - **CHECKED**: Item will be added to Allowed.ini (approved)
     - **UNCHECKED**: Item will be added to Denied.ini (blocked/deleted)
   - Denied items are deleted after a single confirmation message box.
   - Export List: This exports a full list of items shown in the Review GUI.

4. **Tray Menu Functions**
   - Open settings
   - Exit

## **Main Options**
The Settings GUI features several tabs that allow for detailed configuration and management of monitored startup items.

## **Tabs & Advanced Lists**

---

### **2. Locations Tab**
- **Use Locations Tab** to tailor what areas of the system are monitored—add, remove, or edit to suit your needs. You can use this to monitor any folder or registry key for changes, other than startup.

- **Purpose:**  
  Manage the startup locations that are monitored for changes. These locations typically include registry keys, file paths, and scheduled tasks.
- **How to Use:**
- **Context Menu:** Right click the list view to access options.
  - **List View:** See all locations currently being monitored. Use checkboxes to enable/disable that item. Changes saved immediately.
  - **Remove:** Remove a location if you do not wish to monitor it. A confirmation message appears at the bottom of the window with OK/Cancel buttons.
  - **Edit:** Modify an existing location's settings. Right Click a list view item, select Edit, then the edit field appears below. Make your changes and click the Edit button to save.
  - **Add Registry:** Add a new registry startup location to monitor. Use the "Open RegEdit" from the context menu, then use RegEdit to brwose to your location. Copy the desired path into the edit field, then click "Add Path" button to add to the list.
  - **Add Folder:** Browse to a folder and add it to your monitoring list.
  
- **Typical Locations:**  
  - Registry keys like `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - Startup folders
  - Windows Scheduled Tasks

- **Default Locations:**
```

### **3. Allowed Tab**

- **Purpose:**  
  Manage the list of startup items that are explicitly allowed. Items in this list will not trigger alerts or warnings.
- **How to Use:**
- **Context Menu**
  - **Remove:** Remove items that are no longer trusted. Select item in the list view, click "Remove". Review the confirmation at the bottom of the window and select OK/Cancel as desired.
  - **Refresh:** Refreshes list. Unlikely to be required as changes are applied immediately, but, just in case!
  - **CopyPath:** Copies the full path of selected item.
- **Use Case:**  
  For trusted programs you know and want to keep running at startup.

---

### **4. Denied Tab**

- **Purpose:**  
  Manage the list of startup items that are explicitly denied. Any item matching entries in this list will trigger alerts and may be blocked.
- **How to Use:**  
- **Context Menu**
  - **Remove:** Remove entries if a program is no longer considered a threat. Select item in the list view, click "Remove". Review the confirmation at the bottom of the window and select OK/Cancel as desired.
  - **Refresh:** Refreshes list. Unlikely to be required as changes are applied immediately, but, just in case!
  - **CopyPath:** Copies the full path of selected item.
- **Use Case:**  
  For known threats, unwanted software, or items you want to prevent from running at startup.

---

### **5. Other Tabs**

Additional tabs for advanced settings, such as:
- **Baseline:**  View and manage the persistent baseline of startup items.  
  - **Use:** See which items were present during initial setup and adjust baseline as needed. Click to view full path and at the same time copy the full path to the clipboard.
- **Log:**  View logging details, such as log file path and retention. Delete existing log to start afresh. You can select and right click to copy or use keyboard shortcuts.

---

## **Managing Tabs Effectively**

- **Use Allowed and Denied Tabs** to fine-tune which startup items are permitted or blocked. For example if a review was accidentally accepted or denied, you can amend here.
- **Review Baseline** periodically to ensure new legitimate items are included, and old ones are removed.
- **Consult Log Tab** for troubleshooting or audit purposes.

---

## **Typical Usage Flow**

1. **Configure monitoring frequency and targets** in Main Settings.
2. **Review Locations Tab**—add or remove monitored areas.
3. **Populate Allowed Tab** with trusted items to reduce unnecessary alerts.
4. **Populate Denied Tab** with unwanted or suspicious items for proactive blocking.
5. **Check Baseline and Log Tabs** for additional control and troubleshooting.
6. **Save and exit**—settings take effect immediately.

---

## **Notes**

- Invalid values prompt warnings and revert to previous/default settings.
- The GUI is fixed-size and cannot be resized by dragging.
- All changes are saved automatically unless otherwise specified.
